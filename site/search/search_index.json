Preamble # The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS # 0. Definitions. # \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. 1. Source Code. # The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. 2. Basic Permissions. # All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. # No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies. # You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions. # You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms. # You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. 7. Additional Terms. # \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. 8. Termination. # You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. # You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. # Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. 11. Patents. # A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. # If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License. # Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such. 14. Revised Versions of this License. # The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. 15. Disclaimer of Warranty. # THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. Limitation of Liability. # IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. # If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs # If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 one line to give the program s name and a brief idea of what it does.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it. For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions. Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users. Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.","title":"Preamble"},{"location":"license/#terms-and-conditions","text":"","title":"TERMS AND CONDITIONS"},{"location":"license/#0-definitions","text":"\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.","title":"0.

A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

If you are already familiar with cvs and are just trying to learn a particular feature or remember a certain command, you can probably skip everything here. What is cvs ?: What you can do with cvs What is cvs not ?: Problems cvs doesn't try to solve A sample session : A tour of basic cvs usage What is cvs # cvs is a version control system. Using it, you can record the history of your source files. For example, bugs sometimes creep in when software is modified, and you might not detect the bug until a long time after you make the modification. With cvs , you can easily retrieve old versions to see exactly which change caused the bug. This can sometimes be a big help. You could of course save every version of every file you have ever created. This would however waste an enormous amount of disk space. cvs stores all the versions of a file in a single file in a clever way that only stores the differences between versions. cvs also helps you if you are part of a group of people working on the same project. It is all too easy to overwrite each others' changes unless you are extremely careful. Some editors, like gnu Emacs, try to make sure that two people never modify the same file at the same time. Unfortunately, if someone is using another editor, that safeguard will not work. cvs solves this problem by insulating the different developers from each other. Every developer works in his own directory, and cvs merges the work when each developer is done. cvs started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by Dick Grune, posted to the newsgroup comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release of July, 1986. While no actual code from these shell scripts is present in the current version of cvs much of the cvs conflict resolution algorithms come from them. In April, 1989, Brian Berliner designed and coded cvs . Jeff Polk later helped Brian with the design of the cvs module and vendor branch support. You can get cvs in a variety of ways, including free download from the Internet. For more information on downloading cvs and other cvs topics, see: http://cvs.nongnu.org/ There is a mailing list, known as info-cvs@nongnu.org , devoted to cvs . To subscribe or unsubscribe write to info-cvs-request@nongnu.org . If you prefer a Usenet group, there is a one-way mirror (posts to the email list are usually sent to the news group, but not visa versa) of info-cvs@nongnu.org at news:gnu.cvs.help. The right Usenet group for posts is news:comp.software.config-mgmt which is for cvs discussions (along with other configuration management systems). In the future, it might be possible to create a comp.software.config-mgmt.cvs, but probably only if there is sufficient cvs traffic on news:comp.software.config-mgmt. You can also subscribe to the bug-cvs@nongnu.org mailing list, described in more detail in BUGS. To subscribe send mail to bug-cvs-request@nongnu.org . There is a two-way Usenet mirror (posts to the Usenet group are usually sent to the email list and visa versa) of bug-cvs@nongnu.org named news:gnu.cvs.bug. What is cvs not # cvs can do a lot of things for you, but it does not try to be everything for everyone. cvs is not a build system. Though the structure of your repository and modules file interact with your build system (e.g. Makefiles), they are essentially independent. cvs does not dictate how you build anything. It merely stores files for retrieval in a tree structure you devise. cvs does not dictate how to use disk space in the checked out working directories. If you write your Makefiles or scripts in every directory so they have to know the relative positions of everything else, you wind up requiring the entire repository to be checked out. If you modularize your work, and construct a build system that will share files (via links, mounts, VPATH in Makefiles, etc.), you can arrange your disk usage however you like. But you have to remember that any such system is a lot of work to construct and maintain. cvs does not address the issues involved. Of course, you should place the tools created to support such a build system (scripts, Makefiles, etc) under cvs . Figuring out what files need to be rebuilt when something changes is, again, something to be handled outside the scope of cvs . One traditional approach is to use make for building, and use some automated tool for generating the dependencies which make uses. See Builds , for more information on doing builds in conjunction with cvs . cvs is not a substitute for management. Your managers and project leaders are expected to talk to you frequently enough to make certain you are aware of schedules, merge points, branch names and release dates. If they don't, cvs can't help. cvs is an instrument for making sources dance to your tune. But you are the piper and the composer. No instrument plays itself or writes its own music. cvs is not a substitute for developer communication. When faced with conflicts within a single file, most developers manage to resolve them without too much effort. But a more general definition of \u201cconflict\u201d includes problems too difficult to solve without communication between developers. cvs cannot determine when simultaneous changes within a single file, or across a whole collection of files, will logically conflict with one another. Its concept of a conflict is purely textual, arising when two changes to the same base file are near enough to spook the merge (i.e. diff3) command. cvs does not claim to help at all in figuring out non-textual or distributed conflicts in program logic. For example: Say you change the arguments to function X defined in file A. At the same time, someone edits file B, adding new calls to function X using the old arguments. You are outside the realm of cvs 's competence. Acquire the habit of reading specs and talking to your peers. cvs does not have change control Change control refers to a number of things. First of all it can mean bug-tracking, that is being able to keep a database of reported bugs and the status of each one (is it fixed? in what release? has the bug submitter agreed that it is fixed?). For interfacing cvs to an external bug-tracking system, see the rcsinfo and verifymsg files (see Administrative files ). Another aspect of change control is keeping track of the fact that changes to several files were in fact changed together as one logical change. If you check in several files in a single cvs commit operation, cvs then forgets that those files were checked in together, and the fact that they have the same log message is the only thing tying them together. Keeping a gnu style ChangeLog can help somewhat. Another aspect of change control, in some systems, is the ability to keep track of the status of each change. Some changes have been written by a developer, others have been reviewed by a second developer, and so on. Generally, the way to do this with cvs is to generate a diff (using cvs diff or diff) and email it to someone who can then apply it using the patch utility. This is very flexible, but depends on mechanisms outside cvs to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. cvs is not an automated testing program It should be possible to enforce mandatory use of a test suite using the commitinfo file. I haven't heard a lot about projects trying to do that or whether there are subtle gotchas, however. cvs does not have a built-in process model Some systems provide ways to ensure that changes or releases go through various steps, with various approvals as needed. Generally, one can accomplish this with cvs but it might be a little more work. In some cases you'll want to use the commitinfo, loginfo, rcsinfo, or verifymsg files, to require that certain steps be performed before cvs will allow a checkin. Also consider whether features such as branches and tags can be used to perform tasks such as doing work in a development tree and then merging certain changes over to a stable tree only once they have been proven. A Sample Session # As a way of introducing cvs , we'll go through a typical work-session using cvs . The first thing to understand is that cvs stores all files in a centralized repository (see Repository ); this section assumes that a repository is set up. Suppose you are working on a simple compiler. The source consists of a handful of C files and a Makefile. The compiler is called tc (Trivial Compiler), and the repository is set up so that there is a module called tc . Getting the source Committing your changes Cleaning up Viewing differences Getting the source # The first thing you must do is to get your own working copy of the source for `tc'. For this, you use the checkout command: 1 $ cvs checkout tc This will create a new directory called tc and populate it with the source files. 1 2 3 $ cd tc $ ls cvs Makefile backend.c driver.c frontend.c parser.c The cvs directory is used internally by cvs . Normally, you should not modify or remove any of the files in it. You start your favorite editor, hack away at backend.c, and a couple of hours later you have added an optimization pass to the compiler. A note to rcs and sccs users: There is no need to lock the files that you want to edit. See Multiple developers , for an explanation. Next: Cleaning up, Previous: Getting the source, Up: A sample session Committing your changes # When you have checked that the compiler is still compilable you decide to make a new version of backend.c . This will store your new backend.c in the repository and make it available to anyone else who is using that same repository. 1 $ cvs commit backend.c cvs starts an editor, to allow you to enter a log message. You type in \"Added an optimization pass.\" , save the temporary file, and exit the editor. The environment variable $CVSEDITOR determines which editor is started. If $CVSEDITOR is not set, then if the environment variable $EDITOR is set, it will be used. If both $CVSEDITOR and $EDITOR are not set then there is a default which will vary with your operating system, for example vi for unix or notepad for Windows NT/95. In addition, cvs checks the $VISUAL environment variable. Opinions vary on whether this behavior is desirable and whether future releases of cvs should check $VISUAL or ignore it. You will be OK either way if you make sure that $VISUAL is either unset or set to the same thing as $EDITOR . When cvs starts the editor, it includes a list of files which are modified. For the cvs client, this list is based on comparing the modification time of the file against the modification time that the file had when it was last gotten or updated. Therefore, if a file's modification time has changed but its contents have not, it will show up as modified. The simplest way to handle this is simply not to worry about it\u2014if you proceed with the commit cvs will detect that the contents are not modified and treat it as an unmodified file. The next update will clue cvs in to the fact that the file is unmodified, and it will reset its stored timestamp so that the file will not show up in future editor sessions. If you want to avoid starting an editor you can specify the log message on the command line using the -m flag instead, like this: 1 $ cvs commit -m Added an optimization pass backend.c Next: Viewing differences, Previous: Committing your changes, Up: A sample session Cleaning up # Before you turn to other tasks you decide to remove your working copy of tc. One acceptable way to do that is of course 1 2 $ cd .. $ rm -r tc but a better way is to use the release command (see release ): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ cd .. $ cvs release -d tc M driver.c ? tc You have [ 1 ] altered files in this repository. Are you sure you want to release ( and delete ) directory tc : n ** release aborted by user choice. The release command checks that all your modifications have been committed. If history logging is enabled it also makes a note in the history file. See history file . When you use the -d flag with release , it also removes your working copy. In the example above, the release command wrote a couple of lines of output. ? tc means that the file tc is unknown to cvs . That is nothing to worry about: tc is the executable compiler, and it should not be stored in the repository. See cvsignore , for information about how to make that warning go away. See release output , for a complete explanation of all possible output from release . M driver.c is more serious. It means that the file driver.c has been modified since it was checked out. The release command always finishes by telling you how many modified files you have in your working copy of the sources, and then asks you for confirmation before deleting any files or making any note in the history file. You decide to play it safe and answer n RET when release asks for confirmation. Viewing differences # You do not remember modifying driver.c, so you want to see what has happened to that file. 1 2 $ cd tc $ cvs diff driver.c This command runs diff to compare the version of driver.c that you checked out with your working copy. When you see the output you remember that you added a command line option that enabled the optimization pass. You check it in, and release the module. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $ cvs commit -m Added an optimization pass driver.c Checking in driver.c ; /usr/local/cvsroot/tc/driver.c,v -- driver.c new revision: 1 .2 ; previous revision: 1 .1 done $ cd .. $ cvs release -d tc ? tc You have [ 0 ] altered files in this repository.

Using it, you can record the history of your source files. For example, bugs sometimes creep in when software is modified, and you might not detect the bug until a long time after you make the modification. With cvs , you can easily retrieve old versions to see exactly which change caused the bug. This can sometimes be a big help. You could of course save every version of every file you have ever created. This would however waste an enormous amount of disk space. cvs stores all the versions of a file in a single file in a clever way that only stores the differences between versions. cvs also helps you if you are part of a group of people working on the same project. It is all too easy to overwrite each others' changes unless you are extremely careful. Some editors, like gnu Emacs, try to make sure that two people never modify the same file at the same time. Unfortunately, if someone is using another editor, that safeguard will not work. cvs solves this problem by insulating the different developers from each other. Every developer works in his own directory, and cvs merges the work when each developer is done. cvs started out as a bunch of shell scripts written by Dick Grune, posted to the newsgroup comp.sources.unix in the volume 6 release of July, 1986. While no actual code from these shell scripts is present in the current version of cvs much of the cvs conflict resolution algorithms come from them.

The client connects, sends the usual kerberos authentication information, and then starts the cvs protocol.

Servers need not support all mechanisms, and in fact servers will typically want to support only those mechanisms which meet the relevant security needs. The pserver server listens on a port (in the current implementation, by having inetd call cvs pserver ) which defaults to 2401 (this port is officially registered). The client connects, and sends the following: the string BEGIN AUTH REQUEST , a linefeed, the cvs root, a linefeed, the username, a linefeed, the password trivially encoded (see Password scrambling), a linefeed, the string END AUTH REQUEST , and a linefeed. The client must send the identical string for cvs root both here and later in the Root request of the cvs protocol itself. Servers are encouraged to enforce this restriction. The possible server responses (each of which is followed by a linefeed) are the following. Note that although there is a small similarity between this authentication protocol and the cvs protocol, they are separate. I LOVE YOU The authentication is successful. The client proceeds with the cvs protocol itself. I HATE YOU The authentication fails. After sending this response, the server may close the connection. It is up to the server to decide whether to give this response, which is generic, or a more specific response using E and/or error . E text Provide a message for the user. After this reponse, the authentication protocol continues with another response. Typically the server will provide a series of E responses followed by error . Compatibility Note cvs 1.9.10 and older clients will print unrecognized auth response and text , and then exit, upon receiving this response. error code text The authentication fails. After sending this response, the server may close the connection. The code is a code describing why it failed, intended for computer consumption. The only code currently defined is 0 which is nonspecific, but clients must silently treat any unrecognized codes as nonspecific. The text should be supplied to the user. Compatibility Note cvs 1.9.10 and older clients will print unrecognized auth response and text , and then exit, upon receiving this response. Note text for this response, or the text in an E response, is not designed for machine parsing. More vigorous use of code, or future extensions, will be needed to prove a cleaner machine-parseable indication of what the error was. If the client wishes to merely authenticate without starting the cvs protocol, the procedure is the same, except: BEGIN AUTH REQUEST is replaced with BEGIN VERIFICATION REQUEST , END AUTH REQUEST is replaced with END VERIFICATION REQUEST , Upon receipt of I LOVE YOU the connection is closed instead of continuing. Another mechanism is GSSAPI authentication. GSSAPI is a generic interface to security services such as kerberos. GSSAPI is specified in RFC2078 (GSSAPI version 2) and RFC1508 (GSSAPI version 1); we are not aware of differences between the two which affect the protocol in incompatible ways, so we make no attempt to specify one version or the other. The procedure here is to start with BEGIN GSSAPI REQUEST . GSSAPI authentication information is then exchanged between the client and the server. Each packet of information consists of a two byte big endian length, followed by that many bytes of data. After the GSSAPI authentication is complete, the server continues with the responses described above ( I LOVE YOU , etc.). future possibilities # There are nearly an unlimited number of ways to connect and authenticate. One might want to allow access based on IP address (similar to the usual rsh protocol but with different/no restrictions on ports 1024), to adopt mechanisms such as Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), to allow users to run their own servers under their own usernames without root access, or any number of other possibilities. The way to add future mechanisms, for the most part, should be to continue to use port 2401, but to use different strings in place of BEGIN AUTH REQUEST .","title":"Connection and Authentication"},{"location":"server-conn-auth/#how-to-connect-to-and-authenticate-oneself-to-the-cvs-server","text":"Connection and authentication occurs before the CVS protocol itself is started.

Compatibility Note cvs 1.9.10 and older clients will print unrecognized auth response and text , and then exit, upon receiving this response. error code text The authentication fails. After sending this response, the server may close the connection. The code is a code describing why it failed, intended for computer consumption. The only code currently defined is 0 which is nonspecific, but clients must silently treat any unrecognized codes as nonspecific. The text should be supplied to the user. Compatibility Note cvs 1.9.10 and older clients will print unrecognized auth response and text , and then exit, upon receiving this response. Note text for this response, or the text in an E response, is not designed for machine parsing. More vigorous use of code, or future extensions, will be needed to prove a cleaner machine-parseable indication of what the error was. If the client wishes to merely authenticate without starting the cvs protocol, the procedure is the same, except: BEGIN AUTH REQUEST is replaced with BEGIN VERIFICATION REQUEST , END AUTH REQUEST is replaced with END VERIFICATION REQUEST , Upon receipt of I LOVE YOU the connection is closed instead of continuing. Another mechanism is GSSAPI authentication. GSSAPI is a generic interface to security services such as kerberos. GSSAPI is specified in RFC2078 (GSSAPI version 2) and RFC1508 (GSSAPI version 1); we are not aware of differences between the two which affect the protocol in incompatible ways, so we make no attempt to specify one version or the other. The procedure here is to start with BEGIN GSSAPI REQUEST . GSSAPI authentication information is then exchanged between the client and the server. Each packet of information consists of a two byte big endian length, followed by that many bytes of data. After the GSSAPI authentication is complete, the server continues with the responses described above ( I LOVE YOU , etc.).","title":"pserver"},{"location":"server-conn-auth/#future-possibilities","text":"There are nearly an unlimited number of ways to connect and authenticate. One might want to allow access based on IP address (similar to the usual rsh protocol but with different/no restrictions on ports 1024), to adopt mechanisms such as Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM), to allow users to run their own servers under their own usernames without root access, or any number of other possibilities. The way to add future mechanisms, for the most part, should be to continue to use port 2401, but to use different strings in place of BEGIN AUTH REQUEST .","title":"future possibilities"},{"location":"server-goals/","text":"Goals # Do not assume any access to the repository other than via this protocol. It does not depend on NFS, rdist, etc. Providing a reliable transport is outside this protocol. The protocol expects a reliable transport that is transparent (that is, there is no translation of characters, including characters such as linefeeds or carriage returns), and can transmit all 256 octets (for example for proper handling of binary files, compression, and encryption). The encoding of characters specified by the protocol (the names of requests and so on) is the invariant ISO 646 character set (a subset of most popular character sets including ASCII and others). For more details on running the protocol over the TCP reliable transport, see Connection and Authentication . Security and authentication are handled outside this protocol (but see below about cvs kserver and cvs pserver ). The protocol makes it possible for updates to be atomic with respect to checkins; that is if someone commits changes to several files in one cvs command, then an update by someone else would either get all the changes, or none of them. The current cvs server can't do this, but that isn't the protocol's fault. The protocol is, with a few exceptions, transaction-based. That is, the client sends all its requests (without waiting for server responses), and then waits for the server to send back all responses (without waiting for further client requests). This has the advantage of minimizing network turnarounds and the disadvantage of sometimes transferring more data than would be necessary if there were a richer interaction. Another, more subtle, advantage is that there is no need for the protocol to provide locking for features such as making checkins atomic with respect to updates. Any such locking can be handled entirely by the server. A good server implementation (such as the current cvs server) will make sure that it does not have any such locks in place whenever it is waiting for communication with the client; this prevents one client on a slow or flaky network from interfering with the work of others. It is a general design goal to provide only one way to do a given operation (where possible). For example, implementations have no choice about whether to terminate lines with linefeeds or some other character(s), and request and response names are case-sensitive. This is to enhance interoperability. If a protocol allows more than one way to do something, it is all too easy for some implementations to support only some of them (perhaps accidentally).","title":"Goals"},{"location":"server-goals/#goals","text":"Do not assume any access to the repository other than via this protocol.
